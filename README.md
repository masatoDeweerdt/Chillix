## Mission objectives 

Putting into practice wat we learned 

## The Mission

In this exercise we must create a Streaming site in html / css, javascript and php.

We get inspired by Netflix.
The goal is to display a catalog of movies. 

### Must-have features

- A session system: registration, connection / disconnection.
- Different rights: registrants have the right to comment on the content. You can add other rights depending on the different types of users.
- Include a search bar and sort by filters
- Make a secure code
- Deploy the site. PHP is not supported by github, find free alternatives.

### Nice-to-have features

- Management of lost passwords.
- Back office for user and comment management (CRUD).
- Create a page or section that displays the top movies with the movie db API.
- Integrate a newsletter with Mailchimp.

### Miscellanous information

- The videos are not hosted, it are a simple link to the Youtube trailer.
